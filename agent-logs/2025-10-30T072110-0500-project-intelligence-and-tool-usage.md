# Session Summary
- Added end-to-end tests for blueprint/session flows (`src/__tests__/project-intelligence.test.ts`) exercising `ProjectIntelligenceEngine` and `ProjectIntelligenceTools` on a synthetic project.
- Introduced `IN_MEMORIA_DISABLE_PROJECT_INTEL` feature flag with CLI/MCP guardrails and documented the opt-out path.
- Implemented tool usage telemetry: migration v6 (`tool_usage` table), `SQLiteDatabase.recordToolInvocation/getToolUsageSummary`, automatic logging in the MCP server, and a reporting helper (`scripts/summarize-tool-usage.ts`).
- Documented changes across README, AGENTS, CHANGELOG, and plan docs; created status updates for the project intelligence MVP.

## Commands Executed
- `npm test -- --run project-intelligence`
- `npm test -- --run sqlite-db`
- `npm run build`

## Notes
- Workstream A remaining to-dos: publish ERD/diagram assets and finalize release checklist before closing MVP.
- Workstream C next steps: analyze `tool_usage` data and draft the consolidation RFC (telemetry capture is now in place).
