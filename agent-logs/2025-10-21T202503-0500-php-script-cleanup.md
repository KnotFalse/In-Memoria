# Session Notes
- Investigated tmp script hang issue: both manual-metrics.ts and get-performance-status.ts instantiate SemanticEngine/SemanticVectorDB/SQLiteDatabase without cleanup, leaving timers (SemanticEngine cleanup interval) and SurrealDB sockets open so Node never exits.
- Added lesson to memory MCP: ensure tmp scripts call semanticEngine.cleanup(), vectorDB.close(), database.close().
- Updated tmp/get-performance-status.ts and tmp/manual-metrics.ts to wrap execution in try/finally, invoking cleanup/close to prevent hangs.
- Verified scripts now exit promptly after printing results.
