# Session Log – PHP Integration Phase 1 Checkpoint
- Timestamp: 2025-10-20T15:35:08-0500
- Branch: In-Memoria: feat/php-language-support @ fc20562 (dirty)

## Scope
- Re-confirmed status of TypeScript ignore defaults and PHP instrumentation work to unblock Step 6 dependencies.
- Updated the shared php-integration plan, Neo4j goal memory, and session notes for future agents.

## Findings
- `src/watchers/file-watcher.ts` default ignores now cover `vendor/`, `storage/`, `var/`, `bootstrap/cache/`, `composer.lock`, and `*.min.php`; blanket `cache/` remains unset (intentionally) to avoid swallowing first-party caches.
- PHP composer insights and template toggles remain in place (`src/utils/composer.ts`, `src/watchers/file-watcher.ts`).
- Rust core instrumentation captures per-language metrics (`rust-core/src/analysis/semantic.rs`) and flows through `SemanticEngine` / monitoring tools, but runtime metrics stay zero until the napi binary is rebuilt outside the sandbox.
- `src/mcp-server/tools/monitoring-tools.ts` surfaces the new per-language metric fields, and unit tests rely on TS fallback metrics injection.

## Updates
- `php-integration-plan.md`: documented watcher-ignore status, partial Step 6 completion, and refreshed “Next Actions” (2025-10-20 update).
- Neo4j goal #5 (“PHP integration Phase 1 implementation”): refreshed description with current blockers and next steps.

## Outstanding
- Rebuild `rust-core` with the new napi exports to deliver live PHP parse timings before closing Step 6.
- Decide on the `cache/` ignore strategy and document the outcome.
- Spin up the Step 7 QA harness once instrumentation is validated.

## Tests
- Not run (investigation only).
