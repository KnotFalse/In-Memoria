# Session Summary
- Merged `upstream/main` (v0.5.6 consolidation) into `feat/php-language-support`, reconciled conflicts, restored legacy PHP/project-intelligence files, and force-pushed the updated branch (`7aa4f45`).
- Re-added CLI `blueprint` command, project-intelligence MCP tools, PHP scripts/fixtures, and historical documentation/agent logs for future workstreams.
- Verified `npm test -- --run project-intelligence` succeeds; full `npm run build` still fails because upstream API changes broke our PHP integration tests and blueprint helpers.
- Attempted to run PHP telemetry scripts; current LearningService output reports zero PHP concepts and the GitHub workflow cannot be dispatched from the feature branch, so telemetry collection remains unsatisfied.
- Tool-usage summarizer now errors because `SQLiteDatabase` lost the convenience helpers in v0.5.6; real telemetry update deferred.

## Outstanding Work
- Restore build/test parity by adapting PHP test expectations and project-intelligence storage helpers to the new schema.
- Modernize telemetry/harness scripts to use LearningService output so workflow evidence can be captured.
- Reintroduce tool-usage logging/summarization compatible with the current database layout.
- Decide/document how contributors should run Rust tests under the N-API build.

## Commands Executed
- `git fetch upstream` / `git merge upstream/main` / conflict resolution with `git stash` flows
- `npm test -- --run project-intelligence`
- `npx tsx scripts/run-php-telemetry.ts ...`
- `npx tsx scripts/php-integration-check.ts ...`
- `npm run build` (fails as noted)
- `git push origin feat/php-language-support --force`

## Repo Notes
- Branch `feat/php-language-support` @ `7aa4f45`.
- Workspace currently clean; build/test fixes and telemetry modernization pending next session.
