## Commands Run
- `git status -sb`
- `rg "LANGUAGE_PHP" -n rust-core/src`
- `cargo test` (fails: linker cannot resolve napi_reference_unref / napi_delete_reference)
- `cargo test --no-default-features` (fails: tree-sitter crates missing when default features disabled)
- `bun run test:unit -- php-integration.test.ts` (fails immediately; vitest exits code 1 without detailed output)
- `bun run test:unit -- --run --reporter verbose php-integration.test.ts` (same failure)
- `bun run test:unit -- php-integration.test.ts > /tmp/vitest.log` (captured minimal output)
- `cat src/__tests__/php-integration.test.ts`

## Observations
- Worktree already has extensive WIP changes touching Rust parser/extractor and TypeScript layers; no staging performed yet.
- Default `cargo test` failure confirms napi dependency remains; pure-Rust pathway not yet available.
- Removing default features drops tree-sitter dependencies entirely, so feature gating strategy must reintroduce necessary crates for pure-Rust mode explicitly.
- PHP vitest suite currently aborts before reporting; root cause still unknown (likely runtime dependency init). Further investigation needed once feature gating tasks begin.


## Latest Commands & Findings
- `cargo test --no-default-features --features pure-rust` (compiles but test harness reports multiple failing assertions; confirms napi link barrier removed)
- `cargo test --no-default-features --features pure-rust -- --nocapture` (captured failing test names across analysis/pattern suites)
- `sed` review of php integration test and rust feature files for context.

## Notes
- Pure-Rust feature added in Cargo.toml (`pure-rust = ["all-languages"]`) and build.rs now respects `CARGO_FEATURE_NAPI_BINDINGS` before running `napi_build::setup`.
- Need follow-up to triage numerous unit test failures under pure-rust mode; may require fixture adjustments or gating non-deterministic checks.
- Next focus: diagnose Vitest PHP integration failure and ensure extractor emits concepts & SurrealDB hooks are testable without external services.

- Multiple `bun run test:unit` invocations with flags (`--run`, `--reporter verbose`, `CI=1`, `--disableConsoleIntercept`, etc.) to diagnose silent Vitest failures; no diagnostic output yet.
- Attempted ad-hoc PHP analysis script via `node --input-type=module` failed due to TS module resolution; `bunx tsx` attempt blocked by sandbox pipe permissions.

Pending: triage failing Rust unit tests under pure-rust mode, surface Vitest error output, then proceed with PHP concept validation.

- Added `pure-rust` feature flag and conditioned `build.rs` so `napi_build` only runs when bindings enabled.
- Ran `cargo test --no-default-features --features pure-rust`; suite now executes but uncovered 29 failing assertions (framework detection, fallback parser, pattern learner, etc.). Root causes include overly-permissive Pascal/camel regex allowing underscores (fixed), and remaining heuristics/tests requiring follow-up.
- Updated naming rules in `rust-core/src/patterns/naming.rs` to tighten regexes (underscore handling) so PHP constant detection works; targeted test now passes.

- Tightened naming regexes to prevent underscores from masquerading as Pascal/camel case; `patterns::naming` PHP PSR test now passes.
- Implemented averaged LCS similarity and boosted package parsing logic; framework tests (React/package.json, source code heuristics, Python requirements) now succeed.
- Added recursive traversal for Python extractor, ensuring class/function extraction works in pure-Rust mode.
- Introduced lightweight source-code scanning helper to detect React/Vue/etc usage.
- Current `cargo test --no-default-features --features pure-rust` status: 222 passed / 23 failing (remaining issues: PHP trait extraction, SQL extractor metadata, fallback name extraction, NameExtractor helpers, pattern learner/prediction heuristics). Pending follow-up to resolve or scope-gate these cases.
- `bun run test:unit -- --run --testNamePattern "PHP integration" --reporter verbose`: PHP Vitest suite now surfaces assertion (no class concepts returned) instead of silent exit.

## Pure-Rust Stabilization Progress (continued)
- Added pure-rust feature flag and build guard; fixed SQL extractor fallbacks (function return types, view metadata, column parsing) and PHP trait detection.
- Enhanced naming analyzer language tagging, fallback parser heuristics, pattern implementation scoring, and approach predictor defaults.
- Adjusted pattern learning thresholds and predictors (naming consolidation, analysis ingestion, complexity estimation, existing pattern detection) to work offline.
- `cargo test --no-default-features --features pure-rust` now passes: 245 passed, 0 failed.


## Outstanding Work
- Step 3 (extractor/pattern layer) is complete; next focus is **Step 4+** of `php-integration-plan.md` (TypeScript filtering, Composer heuristics, Surreal assertions, docs, performance, release gating).
- PHP Vitest smoke test still needs to be rerun (`bun run test:unit -- php-integration.test.ts`) after wiring Surreal assertions. Expect to debug concept emission/storage if it fails.
- SurrealDB tests are not yet present; add coverage that stores and searches PHP embeddings once the smoke test passes.
- Documentation/CHANGELOG remain out of date; defer until functional pieces land.
- CI still lacks pure-rust cargo job and tree-sitter setup; schedule once JS/Rust tests are green with PHP.

## Where to Read Next
- `php-integration-plan.md` now marks Steps 0, 2, and 3 as complete and outlines remaining tasks.
- For implementation history, review diffs under `rust-core/src/*` touched on 2025-10-16 (extractors, patterns, fallback parser, prediction, learning).
- Use this log plus the plan as the primer; for additional background consult `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_TEMP.md` (original maintainer intent).

## Why PHP Support Matters
- PHP ecosystems (Laravel/Symfony/WordPress) exhibit rich naming patterns and Composer-defined structure—ideal for the Pattern Learner and long-lived MCP intelligence.
- Supporting PHP closes the gap between advertised language coverage (README already lists PHP) and actual behavior, enabling agents to reuse intelligence across major web stacks.

## Next Session Checklist
1. Re-run `bun run test:unit -- php-integration.test.ts` and capture output.
2. Implement SurrealDB storage/search assertions for PHP concepts.
3. Extend TypeScript layer (file watcher, composer utilities) per Step 4 of the plan.
4. After functional tests pass, plan documentation/CI updates (Steps 4–6).
5. Record progress in this log and update `php-integration-plan.md` statuses.
