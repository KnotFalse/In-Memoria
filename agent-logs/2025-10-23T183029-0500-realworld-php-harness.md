# Session Summary
- Added real-world PHP fixtures as git submodules (WooCommerce, Elementor, Koel, Symfony demo, phpMyAdmin) and captured a manifest with per-root analysis settings.
- Extended `scripts/php-integration-check.ts` to load fixture metadata, support `--group`/`--fixture` filters, compute concept summaries, and enforce basic telemetry thresholds.
- Introduced `src/__tests__/php-realworld.test.ts` for composer insight checks and template toggle validation; added `vitest.config.ts` to exclude fixture repositories from test discovery.
- Ran the PHP harness across targeted real-world roots to record metrics (outputs under `tmp/metrics/*.json` and aggregate `tmp/metrics/php-integration-report.json`).
- Documented the new workflow in `docs/benchmarks/php.md`, README, and CONTRIBUTING; added a Neo4j lesson noting the real-world smoke coverage.

## Commands Executed
- `git submodule add --depth 1 <repo> tests/fixtures/realworld/<name>` (5 repos)

- `npm run test:php-integration -- --group synthetic`
- `npm run test:php-integration -- --group realworld --fixture ...` (multiple invocations to collect metrics)
