# Session Log â€“ PHP Parser Verification (local build)
- Timestamp: 2025-10-21T16:54:15-0500
- Branch: In-Memoria: feat/php-language-support @ fc20562

## Scope
- Diagnose why `learn` processed zero PHP files and verify concept extraction when using locally rebuilt napi binary.

## Steps
1. Discovered CLI was loading the prebuilt `@in-memoria/linux-x64` binary that predates PHP support (local rebuilds were ignored).
2. Copied freshly built `rust-core/in-memoria-core.linux-x64-gnu.node` into `node_modules/@in-memoria/linux-x64/`, forcing the CLI to use the PHP-capable build.
3. Re-ran `npx tsx src/index.ts learn sandbox-php-sample --yes`.

## Findings
- With the local binary in place the run logs show:
  - `SAFEDELETE_PHP_LOCAL current_dir=/mnt/c/Users/gavin/Work/Local Files/in-memoria`
  - `SAFEDELETE_PHP_LOCAL entry: sandbox-php-sample/src/UserService.php is_file=true`
  - `Processed 1 source files and found 6 concepts`
- Confirms Rust analyzer handles PHP once the right binary is loaded.

## Next
- Remove temporary logging/panic instrumentation (done via git checkout) and keep copying the napi artifact into `node_modules/@in-memoria/linux-x64/` after builds until packaging is updated.
- Proceed with metrics verification / worker pool now that PHP concepts are flowing.
