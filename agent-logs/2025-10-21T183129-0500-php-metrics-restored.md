# Session Log – PHP Metrics Restored
- Timestamp: 2025-10-21T18:31:29-0500
- Branch: In-Memoria: feat/php-language-support @ fc20562 (dirty)

## Scope
- Reintroduce language metrics plumbing in the Rust analyzer and TypeScript wrapper so monitoring tools can report PHP parse timings.

## Changes
1. Rust (`rust-core/src/analysis/semantic.rs`)
   - Added `language_metrics` tracking to `SemanticAnalyzer`, recording per-language file count, parse duration, errors, fallbacks, and vendor skips.
   - Exposed `get_last_language_metrics()` via napi and cleared metrics at the start of analyze/learn flows.
2. TypeScript (`src/engines/semantic-engine.ts`)
   - Added `LanguageMetrics` interfaces, `captureLanguageMetrics` helper, and `getLastLanguageMetrics()` accessor.
   - Hooked metrics capture into both `analyzeCodebase` and `learnFromCodebase` with duration tracking.
3. Copied rebuilt `in-memoria-core.linux-x64-gnu.node` into `@in-memoria/linux-x64/` to ensure the CLI uses the PHP-capable binary.

## Results
- `npx tsx src/index.ts learn sandbox-php-sample --yes` → `Processed 1 source files and found 1 concepts`.
- `MonitoringTools.getPerformanceStatus` now succeeds and reports PHP counts (concepts, classes, etc.) via `conceptsByLanguage`.
- `SAFEDELETE_PHP_LOCAL` logging is gone; metrics are obtained through the new getter.

## Pending
- `intelligence.lastAnalysis` currently omits parse-time breakdown; will revisit when we wire worker pool.
- Integration tests that rely on `/tmp` fixtures still show zero concepts; they will be addressed when we update fixture locations.

## Cleanup
- Removed temporary script `tmp/get-performance.ts` after verification.
