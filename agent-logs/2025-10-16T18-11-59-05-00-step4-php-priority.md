# Session Notes – PHP Step 4 Progress

- **Repository**: in-memoria (branch `feat/php-language-support` @ `fc20562`)
- **Focus**: Completed Phase 1 Step 4A – Composer heuristics, priority directories, and template toggle exposure.

## Actions
- Added priority path resolution and PSR-0 handling in `src/utils/composer.ts`; extended composer tests for PSR-4/PSR-0 coverage.
- Surfaced composer insights through core analysis, documentation, and semantic engine (`src/mcp-server/tools/core-analysis.ts`, `src/engines/semantic-engine.ts`).
- Highlighted composer-derived priority directories in summaries/docs and adjusted directory sorting to prefer PSR-4 paths.
- Added `--include-templates` CLI option for the watcher (`src/index.ts`) and made template patterns opt-in.
- Updated monitoring metrics aggregation to preserve `conceptsByLanguage` output after merging (`src/mcp-server/tools/monitoring-tools.ts`).
- Tightened PHP integration test to cover priority directories and ensure metrics expose PHP counts; seeded concepts via `analyzeFileContent`.

## Tests
- `npx vitest run src/__tests__/composer.test.ts src/__tests__/php-integration.test.ts`

## Next Focus
- Step 5: storage and intelligence validations (Surreal/SQLite assertions, metrics surfacing).
- Step 6: per-language performance instrumentation once Step 5 groundwork is ready.
