# Session Notes – PHP Doc Sync

- **Repository**: in-memoria (branch `feat/php-language-support` @ `fc20562`)
- **Focus**: Resolved documentation/code comment drift claiming PHP parser/extractor were pending.

## Actions
- Updated `php-integration-plan.md` Step 13 to drop already-completed parser/extractor tasks, keeping remaining work focused on TS heuristics, QA, and docs.
- Refreshed `docs/php/phase0-language-support.md` to mark PHP parser/extractor as available and adjusted key observations accordingly.
- Corrected the PHP entry comment in `src/utils/language-registry.ts` to reflect current support status.

## Outstanding / Follow-up
- Continue with TypeScript heuristics, QA automation, and performance instrumentation per revised plan.
- Align other Phase 0 docs if further references to “pending PHP parser” surface.
