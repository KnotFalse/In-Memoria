# Session Notes
- Completed PHP vs. Python baseline capture (Plan Step 6):
  - Prepared fixtures (`tmp/fixtures/php-basic`, `tmp/fixtures/python-basic`) documented in `docs/benchmarks/fixtures.md`.
  - Ran `bunx tsx src/index.ts learn` for `sandbox-php-sample` and `sandbox-python-sample` to refresh intelligence DBs.
  - Added tooling: `scripts/capture-performance-status.ts` (writes JSON metrics) and `scripts/compare-language-metrics.ts` (verifies ±10% threshold with 1ms guard).
  - Stored outputs under `tmp/metrics/` and summarized results in `docs/benchmarks/php.md`.
  - Comparison script passes with PHP query times matching Python baseline (concept queries 1ms, pattern queries 1–2ms).
- Delivered QA harness (Plan Step 7):
  - Added fixtures under `tests/fixtures/php/` (Laravel/Symfony/WordPress demos) and updated `docs/benchmarks/fixtures.md`.
  - Implemented `scripts/php-integration-check.ts` and `npm run test:php-integration` to automate learning + metric capture across fixtures and baseline.
  - Aggregated outputs in `tmp/metrics/php-integration-report.json` and documented harness usage in `docs/benchmarks/php.md`.
- Completed documentation & MCP surfacing refresh (Plan Steps 8–9):
  - README, AGENTS.md, and CHANGELOG now describe PHP support, QA harness, and metrics tooling.
  - Added `scripts/dump-php-mcp.ts` for auditing `analyze_codebase`, `get_developer_profile`, `search_codebase`, and `get_performance_status`; dumped results to `tmp/mcp-results/`.
  - Extended `src/__tests__/php-integration.test.ts` to cover developer profile surfacing and search, with guardrails for PHP metrics.
- Updated plan status (Steps 6–7 complete) and memory `PHP integration Phase 1 implementation` to reflect new state.
