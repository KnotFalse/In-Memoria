# Session Log – PHP Learn CLI Verification
- Timestamp: 2025-10-21T16:16:03-0500
- Branch: In-Memoria: feat/php-language-support @ fc20562 (dirty)

## Scope
- Validate that `in-memoria learn` completes when estimating + running on a small PHP sample, avoiding the prior hang, and note the zero-concept outcome for follow-up.

## Steps
1. Created `sandbox-php-sample/src/UserService.php` (outside `/tmp` so filters don’t skip it by substring).
2. Ran estimator via `npx tsx src/index.ts learn sandbox-php-sample --estimate-only` – outputs correct PHP file counts/cost.
3. Ran full learn `npx tsx src/index.ts learn sandbox-php-sample --yes` – completes quickly (no prompt hang), but Rust reports “Processed 0 source files”.
4. Checked `MonitoringTools.getPerformanceStatus` (temporary script) – metrics populate execution metadata but still no PHP concepts.

## Findings
- CLI flow works when `--yes` used; previous 6h run likely blocked on the prompt.
- Rust `AnalysisConfig` filters still skip PHP files in this path (processed count = 0); needs deeper investigation later.

## Next
- Proceed to embedding worker pool work once PHP concept extraction confirmed; otherwise raise a bug for the analyzer filter.

## Clean-up
- Removed temporary helper binaries/scripts (`rust-core/src/bin/safedelete_php_local_check.rs`, `tmp/check-performance.ts`).
