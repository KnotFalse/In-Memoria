# Session Primer – PHP Integration Phase 1

**Context Snapshot (2025-10-16, branch `feat/php-language-support` @ `fc20562`)**
- Goal: Finish Phase 1 of PHP integration per `php-integration-plan.md` with a narrow focus on PHP support.
- Completed prior to this session: Rust parser & extractor, TypeScript detection, PHP integration tests, doc alignment.
- Just completed (Step 4A): Composer heuristics surfaced end-to-end, priority directories highlighted, template toggle added to CLI/MCP, monitoring preserves PHP metrics.

**What’s Done**
- `src/utils/composer.ts`: now parses PSR-4/PSR-0 autoload, resolves priority directories, emits framework hints.
- `src/mcp-server/tools/core-analysis.ts`: uses composer insights while building project structure and documentation; priority directories sorted to the top.
- `src/engines/semantic-engine.ts`: enriches codebase analysis with PHP insights for downstream tooling.
- `src/index.ts`: `in-memoria watch` accepts `--include-templates`; watcher patterns updated.
- `src/__tests__/composer.test.ts` & `src/__tests__/php-integration.test.ts`: expanded to cover composer heuristics, priority directories, PHP metrics; tests passing via `npx vitest run src/__tests__/composer.test.ts src/__tests__/php-integration.test.ts`.
- `src/mcp-server/tools/monitoring-tools.ts`: ensures PHP concept counts remain visible after aggregation.
- Plan updated: Step 4 notes the completed work.

**Outstanding Work (Phase 1 Remainder)**
- **Step 4 residuals**: confirm default ignore list includes additional PHP artifacts (`composer.lock`, `*.min.php`).
- **Step 5 – Storage & intelligence validation**:
  - Verify SQLite/Surreal store PHP metadata (traits, docblocks) without loss; add assertions/tests.
  - Ensure vector ingestion tags PHP language correctly; consider dedicated Surreal test harness.
  - Update monitoring/intelligence endpoints with PHP-specific totals (beyond concept counts if needed).
- **Step 6 – Performance instrumentation**:
  - Record per-language parse timings/error ratios/vendor skips during semantic analysis; surface in `get_performance_status`.
  - Decide whether instrumentation belongs in Rust (preferred) or TypeScript wrappers, then expose metrics.
- **Step 7 – QA automation & benchmarks**:
  - Script `npm run test:php-integration` to run against cached Laravel/Symfony fixtures and assert heuristics + metrics.
  - Add PHP scenario to perf harness and capture baseline results in `docs/benchmarks/`.
- **Step 8-10 – Docs & rollout**:
  - Once metrics/tests land, update README/CHANGELOG/AGENTS with PHP support notes and template toggle info.
  - Decide on feature flag gating before release (not yet touched).

**Suggested Entry Point for Next Session**
1. Start Step 5 by writing integration tests that load stored PHP concepts from SQLite and validating Surreal tagging.
2. Plan instrumentation changes (Step 6) after storage assertions are in place; document desired metrics before coding.

**References for More Context**
- `php-integration-plan.md` (updated with Step 4 completion notes).
- `agent-logs/2025-10-16T17-22-56-05-00-php-doc-sync.md` (previous session’s documentation sync). 
- Composer utilities/tests for examples of priority path handling.

**Reminder**
Sessions are stateless; load this log plus `php-integration-plan.md` on resume. Prioritize PHP-specific scope only; avoid touching unrelated roadmap items.
