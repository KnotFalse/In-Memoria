# Session Log – PHP Integration Phase 1 Step 5 (Storage & Intelligence)
- Timestamp: 2025-10-16T23:17:18-0500
- Branch: In-Memoria: feat/php-language-support @ fc20562

## Scope
- Closed out Step 4 residual by extending watcher/glob ignores for `composer.lock` and `*.min.php`.
- Executed Phase 1 Step 5 tasks: SQLite persistence validation, vector ingestion checks, cross-store guard, PHP metric surfacing.
- Added targeted regression coverage to prevent PHP storage regressions (watcher defaults, SQLite, PHP integration pipeline).

## Implementation Notes
- Updated `src/watchers/file-watcher.ts` & `core-analysis.ts` to ignore Composer artifacts by default; added `src/__tests__/file-watcher.test.ts` regression.
- Extended `src/__tests__/sqlite-db.test.ts` with PHP trait/docblock preservation case.
- Expanded `src/__tests__/php-integration.test.ts` to ensure composer insights, watcher ignores, vector metadata (`language: php`), and monitoring totals stay intact; leveraged `SemanticEngine.persistConcept` helper.
- Refactored `SemanticEngine` to expose `persistConcept` helper for reuse/testing without touching Rust pathways.
- Augmented `MonitoringTools.getPerformanceMetrics` to publish PHP-specific totals (traits, docblocks proxy via counts, attribute usage) in performance output.

## Tests
- `npx vitest run --pool=threads src/__tests__/file-watcher.test.ts src/__tests__/sqlite-db.test.ts src/__tests__/php-integration.test.ts` ✅ (expects Surreal fallback warning; embeddings fall back to heuristic generator due to offline mode).

## Outstanding
- Phase 1 Step 6 (performance instrumentation) and beyond remain open per `php-integration-plan.md`.
- Rust analyzer still returns 0 concepts in this fixture during `learnFromCodebase`; future Step 6 may revisit once instrumentation is in place.
