# Session Log: Interaction Directive + Step 0 Prep

## Repository State
- In-Memoria: main @ b0de3d5

## Key Activities
- Added session-wide interaction instructions and logging requirements to `AGENTS.md` per user directive.
- Planned Step 0 verification work for PHP integration (anchors, supported surfaces, motivation, environment readiness).

## Notes
- Session directives now codified in repo; all future interactions must follow the sparring-partner protocol and logging rules.
- Pending: capture relevant recent commits via `git log --oneline -10` before session ends.

## Git History Snapshot
- b0de3d5 fix: syntax error in index.ts and sync package-lock after version bump
- 874ef1b bump: v0.4.6 - CLI help accuracy and learning process crash fixes
- 975ff83 fix: CLI help accuracy and .toFixed() error in complexity analysis, closes #2

## Phase 0 Execution Notes
- Documented architecture flow in `docs/php/phase0-architecture.md` with MCP ⇄ napi ⇄ Rust ⇄ storage trace.
- Built language support matrix `docs/php/phase0-language-support.md`; highlighted mismatches (engines missing SQL/C#/C++ detection despite parsers).
- Analyzed pattern learner pipeline in `docs/php/phase0-patterns.md`; identified need for PHP naming rules and language tagging.
- Captured toolchain status in `docs/php/phase0-env.md`; tree-sitter CLI absent, Composer emits PHP 8.4 `E_STRICT` notices.
- Compiled summary `docs/php/phase0-summary.md` listing blockers before Step 1.

## Commands Run
- `node -v` → v20.11.1
- `npm -v` → 10.2.4
- `rustc -V` → rustc 1.90.0 (1159e78c4 2025-09-14)
- `cargo -V` → cargo 1.90.0 (840b83a10 2025-07-30)
- `tree-sitter --version` → not found
- `composer --version` → Composer 2.7.7 (with PHP 8.4 deprecation notices)

## Git History Update
- No new commits since earlier snapshot; repository still at b0de3d5 atop same history.

## Today’s Execution
- Added centralized language registry (`src/utils/language-registry.ts`) and wired watchers, engines, MCP tooling, and CLI setup to it.
- Updated naming analyzer with PSR-compliant PHP rules and tests (`rust-core/src/patterns/naming.rs`).
- Added `scripts/ensure-tree-sitter-cli.js`, `npm run verify:tree-sitter`, and release workflow steps to install/verify `tree-sitter-cli@0.22.5`.
- Refreshed Phase 0 docs to reflect new state (`docs/php/phase0-env.md`, `docs/php/phase0-summary.md`, `docs/php/phase0-language-support.md`, `docs/php/phase0-patterns.md`).

## Commands Attempted
- `cargo test naming --manifest-path rust-core/Cargo.toml` (failed: no network access to crates.io).
- `npm run typecheck` (skipped due to missing dependencies in sandbox).
