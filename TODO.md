# In-Memoria - Next Phase: True Session Amnesia Solution

**Vision**: Transform In-Memoria from basic pattern detection into a true memory system that lets any AI agent "just go!" without re-explaining context every session.

## 🎯 Mission Critical: Solve Session Amnesia (Phase 1)

### Core Problem
Current In-Memoria learns syntax patterns but lacks the contextual memory needed for true session continuity. AI agents still need to ask basic questions about project goals, architectural preferences, and previous decisions.

### 🚀 Priority 1: Conversation Memory System
- [ ] **Store AI agent interactions** - Capture conversation history, decisions made, and context evolution
- [ ] **Decision tracking** - Record architectural choices with rationale and outcomes  
- [ ] **Suggestion feedback loop** - Track what agent suggestions were accepted/rejected and why
- [ ] **Session state persistence** - Remember what agents were working on when session ended

### 🧠 Priority 2: True Intelligence Engine  
- [ ] **Project goal tracking** - Understand current objectives, constraints, and priorities
- [ ] **Context evolution** - Track how understanding and requirements change over time
- [ ] **Semantic preference learning** - Go beyond syntax to understand *why* certain approaches are chosen
- [ ] **Auto-resume functionality** - Enable AI agents to pick up exactly where they left off

### 🔧 Priority 3: Tool Consolidation (Current: 17 → Target: <17)
- [ ] **Audit current MCP tools** - Identify redundancy and consolidation opportunities
- [ ] **Merge learning tools** - Combine related intelligence functions into unified interfaces
- [ ] **Streamline API surface** - Reduce cognitive load while maintaining functionality
- [ ] **Focus on core value** - Eliminate tools that don't directly support session continuity

## 📈 Success Metrics
- AI agents can resume previous session context without re-explanation
- Agents proactively suggest next steps based on project history  
- Conversation memory enables "just go!" functionality for any AI agent
- Tool count reduced while maintaining core functionality

## 🏗️ Implementation Architecture

### Database Schema Extensions
- **conversations** - Store AI agent interactions with context and decisions
- **session_states** - Track active work, blockers, and next steps
- **decision_history** - Record architectural choices with outcomes
- **preference_learning** - Capture semantic understanding beyond syntax

### API Consolidation Strategy
- Merge related intelligence tools into unified interfaces
- Focus on conversation memory as primary feature
- Eliminate redundant pattern detection tools
- Streamline learning pipeline into single comprehensive tool
