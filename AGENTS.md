# Interaction Instructions
Unless otherwise directed or noted, do not simply affirm my statements or assume my conclusions are correct. Your goal is to be an intellectual sparring partner, not just an agreeable assistant. Every time I present an idea, do the following:
- Analyze my assumptions (What am I taking for granted that might not be true?)
- Provide counterpoints (What would an intelligent, well-informed skeptic say in response?)
- Test my reasoning (Does my logic hold up under scrutiny, or are there flaws or gaps I haven’t considered?)
- Offer alternative perspectives (How else might this idea be framed, interpreted, or challenged?)
- Prioritize truth over agreement (If I am wrong or my logic is weak, I need to know. Correct me clearly and explain why.)
Maintain a constructive, but rigorous, approach. Your role is not to argue for the sake of arguing, but to push me toward greater clarity, accuracy, and intellectual honesty. If I ever start slipping into confirmation bias or unchecked assumptions (that haven't been addressed or noted properly), call it out directly.

### Memory Handling
- When the user says “remember,” persist the information via the neo4j memory MCP server if available, and/or document it in the current session log per the logging rules below.

## Session Logging
- Keep a markdown log under `agent-logs/`; create the directory if it does not exist.
- Name each log file with the local datetime prefix (ISO 8601, sanitized for filenames) followed by a concise description of the session (e.g., `2025-10-07T042304-0500-acme-renewal-investigation.md`).
- Each log covers exactly one interactive session; do not append past that session’s scope.
- When a session introduces or relies on new repository history (branch creation, commit, merge, checkout), record the branch name and relevant short commit hash in the log once the change lands; update this note only when the referenced state changes to avoid noise.
- Note the repository name alongside branch/hash entries in session logs; e.g., `Sentient-Forms-Central-Proxy-Server: main @ abc1234`.
- Before ending a session, run `git log --oneline -10` (or similar) to capture any new commits, including those authored outside the agent, and record the ones relevant to the session in the log.

# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/` contains the TypeScript MCP server (17 tools), tool routing, storage adapters, and file watchers.
- `rust-core/` houses the napi-rs bridge plus semantic analysis, pattern learning, and language extractors.
- `schemas/` stores SQL migrations; `docs/` holds ADRs, API notes, and benchmarks.
- Automated unit tests live in `src/__tests__/`; manual integration harnesses live under `tests/`.
- Intelligence databases (`.in-memoria.db`) persist beside the analyzed project directories, not in-repo.

## Architecture Highlights for Agents
- Data flow: AI client ⇄ TypeScript MCP server ⇄ napi bridge ⇄ Rust engines ⇄ SQLite + embedded SurrealDB (local only).
- Tree-sitter powers parsing for 12 languages (including PHP with Composer heuristics); new languages register in `rust-core` and are exposed via language-agnostic MCP tools.
- File filtering, timeouts, incremental learning, and Composer-aware detection live in the TypeScript layer—extend there for new heuristics.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm install` — install JavaScript dependencies.
- `npm run build:rust` then `npm run build` — compile Rust engines and TypeScript bundle.
- `npm run dev` — start the MCP server in watch mode.
- `npm test`, `npm run test:unit`, `npm run test:integration`, `npm run test:perf` — execute JavaScript test suites.
- `npm run test:php-integration` — run the PHP QA harness (sandbox sample + Laravel/Symfony/WordPress fixtures) and capture metrics under `tmp/metrics/`.
- `npm run fixtures:update-php -- --with-metrics` — refresh PHP real-world fixtures and automatically capture updated benchmarks.
- `npx in-memoria blueprint [path] [--refresh]` — inspect the cached project blueprint, feature map, and work sessions for a project.
- `npm run test -- --run script-cleanup` — enforce that scripts close `SemanticEngine`/`SemanticVectorDB` resources.
- `npx tsx scripts/summarize-tool-usage.ts [project-path]` — inspect MCP tool invocation frequencies captured in the local database.
- Review `docs/release-checklist.md` before finalizing releases.
- `cd rust-core && cargo test` / `cargo clippy` — Rust tests and linting; keep clippy clean.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- TypeScript: strict mode, explicit types, async/await, descriptive identifiers (`analyzeProjectStructure` over `doStuff`).
- Rust: no `unwrap` in library code; prefer `Result`/`?`, iterator combinators, and clippy-compliant idioms.
- Pattern learner expectations follow PSR-style casing (StudlyCaps classes, camelCase methods, UPPER_CASE constants) but always measure repo-specific frequencies.

## Testing Guidelines
- Name tests after the feature under test (`SemanticEngine extracts functions`); colocate fixtures beside suites.
- Run both JS and Rust suites before opening a PR; ensure integration scripts in `tests/` pass when touching MCP flows.
- Add language fixtures that exercise namespaces, classes, enums, attributes, modern syntax, and error recovery.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Use Conventional Commits (`feat: add php tree-sitter extractor`, `fix: prune vendor directory`).
- Include motivation, test evidence, and relevant issue links; update `CHANGELOG.md` for user-facing work.
- Expect reviewers to request `npm test`, `cargo test`, and performance notes; attach screenshots or logs when behavior changes.

## PHP Integration Context
- Roadmap references: `TODO.md` sets the session-amnesia mission; `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_TEMP.md` details the PHP-focused token-efficiency plan; align tasks with both.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (0.4.x series) documents the modular Rust refactor and language registry—re-use those patterns when registering `tree-sitter-php`.
- Mirror extractor semantics from Java/C#/Go for PHP classes, traits, enums, attributes, union types, and promoted properties; feed metrics into the existing frequency tables.
- Extend TypeScript filters to honor Composer PSR-4 roots, skip vendor/cache directories by default, and downweight Blade/Twig templates with an opt-in toggle.
- Gate PHP rollout with `get_performance_status` counters (parse time, error nodes, skipped files) to prove parity before updating README/CHANGELOG.
- Use `scripts/capture-performance-status.ts`, `scripts/compare-language-metrics.ts`, and `npm run test:php-integration` to gather PHP metrics; summarize evidence in `docs/benchmarks/php.md` and `docs/benchmarks/fixtures.md`.
- Capture MCP surfacing evidence with `scripts/dump-php-mcp.ts <fixture> tmp/mcp-results/<name> [search-term]`—outputs structure, developer profile, search, and performance snapshots for audit.

## Agent Playbook
- Start every language integration by mapping parser registration, extractor entry points, TypeScript filters, and MCP tool touchpoints.
- Enforce vendor/cache exclusion, Composer PSR-4 awareness, and framework heuristics when targeting PHP ecosystems.
- Surface diagnostics via `get_performance_status` to prove parity with existing languages before marking tasks complete.
- Use blueprint + work-memory tools (`project_intelligence.*`, `work_memory.*`) to persist next-step context; update sessions through `work_memory.update_context` when handing off work.
- Follow the [PHP monitoring runbook](docs/ops/php-monitoring.md): release rotation reviews telemetry every Monday 09:00 UTC and logs anomalies in Neo4j.
- Disable project intelligence (if needed) via `IN_MEMORIA_DISABLE_PROJECT_INTEL=true`; CLI/MCP will no-op and log reminders when the feature is off.
