# Code Cartographer

**Persistent Intelligence Infrastructure for AI Agents**

Code Cartographer provides foundational infrastructure that enables AI agents to maintain cumulative understanding of codebases across sessions. By building persistent, developer-specific intelligence, it addresses the common "session amnesia" problem in current AI coding tools.

> **Evolution from VS Code Extension**: This project evolved from the original Code Cartographer VS Code extension (a static documentation generator) into a persistent intelligence platform for AI agents. Where the original extension generated documentation files, this system provides dynamic, learning-based intelligence infrastructure.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Persistent AI Memory**: Intelligence persists and grows across sessions
- **Developer-Specific Learning**: Learns your patterns and coding style
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Shared knowledge base for AI agent collaboration
- **Bidirectional Intelligence**: AI agents can contribute insights back to the system

### MCP Integration
- **11 Powerful MCP Tools** for seamless AI agent integration
- **Real-time Intelligence Updates** through file watching

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
- **Concept Extraction Inconsistency**: Tree-sitter semantic analysis occasionally returns 0 concepts due to parsing edge cases
- **Runtime Caching Issues**: Some stub content may persist in documentation due to Node.js module caching
- **Pattern Recognition Scope**: Current ML patterns are primarily algorithmic (naming, structure) rather than deep semantic understanding
- **Database Dependencies**: Requires SQLite and vector database setup, adding complexity compared to simpler tools

### Technical Debt
- **Error Handling**: Some Rust-TypeScript binding failures need better error propagation
- **Performance**: Cold start times for analysis can be slow on large codebases (5+ seconds)
- **Memory Usage**: Vector embeddings can consume significant memory for large projects
- **Platform Support**: Currently tested primarily on Linux; Windows/macOS compatibility may vary

### Areas for Improvement
- **True Semantic Understanding**: Current "AI" is mostly pattern matching; deeper ML models needed for genuine intelligence
- **Integration Friction**: Setup complexity may outweigh benefits for simple use cases
- **Tool Reliability**: Existing Claude Code tools (Grep, Glob) are often more reliable than current search implementation
- **Documentation Quality**: Generated documentation, while intelligent, may be verbose compared to human-written docs

### Recommended Use Cases
**✅ Good fit for:**
- Long-term projects where pattern learning provides value
- Teams establishing coding standards and consistency
- Research into codebase intelligence and AI-assisted development

**❌ Not recommended for:**
- Simple scripts or one-off projects
- Teams preferring lightweight, battle-tested tools
- Production environments requiring maximum reliability
