# PHP Integration – Phase 0 Summary

## Deliverables Produced

- **Architecture trace** – `docs/php/phase0-architecture.md`: verified MCP ↔ napi ↔ Rust ↔ storage call flow with file references.
- **Language surface matrix** – `docs/php/phase0-language-support.md`: compared parser registrations, extractors, TS detection, and watcher coverage.
- **Pattern learner assessment** – `docs/php/phase0-patterns.md`: mapped data flow, schema readiness, and gaps for PHP-specific semantics.
- **Environment report** – `docs/php/phase0-env.md`: captured toolchain versions and now documents the pinned tree-sitter CLI workflow alongside Composer warnings.

## Key Findings

1. **Detection mismatch resolved** – Added `src/utils/language-registry.ts` and wired watchers/engines/MCP tools to it so languages (SQL, C#, C++, PHP, Svelte) no longer degrade to `unknown`. See `docs/php/phase0-language-support.md` for updated matrix.
2. **Pattern learner updated** – Naming analyzer now includes PSR-aligned PHP rules and fixtures; structural/docblock handling remains future work.
3. **Tooling provisioned** – `npm run verify:tree-sitter` plus CI install of `tree-sitter-cli@0.22.5` closes the CLI gap. Composer still reports PHP 8.4 `E_STRICT` deprecations—monitor before CI noise proliferates.
4. **Schema readiness** – SQLite/Surreal stores JSON metadata; no blocker for PHP traits/enums. Ensure metadata encodes `language: 'php'` to prevent cross-language contamination.

## Pre-Step 1 Blocker Status

| Category | Issue | Status / Next Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tooling | tree-sitter CLI availability | ✅ CI installs `tree-sitter-cli@0.22.5`; developers run `npm run verify:tree-sitter` locally before parser work. |
| Detection | Language maps | ✅ Centralized registry keeps watchers/engines/MCP consistent; add regression tests when PHP parser lands. |
| Patterns | PHP naming rules | ✅ PSR naming rules + tests in `rust-core/src/patterns/naming.rs`; docblock/attribute handling deferred to Step 3. |
| Observability | Surreal metadata | ⚠️ Ensure embeddings carry `language: 'php'` once extractor emits PHP concepts; add assertions in Step 3. |

## Recommended Tickets / Owners

1. **Docs** – Update contributor/agent guidance to reference `npm run verify:tree-sitter` and the shared language registry.
2. **Rust Patterns** – Plan follow-up for docblock/attribute heuristics once extractor work commences.
3. **Observability** – Add SurrealDB language-tag assertions when PHP embeddings are introduced.

## Sign-off Checklist

- [ ] Architecture trace reviewed by TS + Rust maintainers.
- [ ] Language matrix acknowledged; follow-up tickets filed.
- [ ] Tooling remediation plan approved (tree-sitter CLI + Composer notice).
- [ ] Step 1 kickoff authorized once above tasks assigned.
