# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

The In-Memoria project is dedicated to building persistent intelligence infrastructure that enhances AI-assisted development. We are committed to providing a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free environment for all contributors, regardless of experience level, background, or perspective.

As contributors and maintainers of an AI tooling infrastructure project, we pledge to foster an open and collaborative community focused on advancing the field of intelligent developer assistance.

## Our Standards

### Positive Behavior
- **Respectful collaboration** on technical discussions about AI, AST parsing, pattern learning, and MCP integration
- **Constructive feedback** on code, architecture decisions, and algorithm implementations
- **Knowledge sharing** about Rust, TypeScript, machine learning, and developer tooling
- **Patient mentorship** for contributors new to AI infrastructure or hybrid language projects
- **Focus on technical merit** in evaluating contributions and proposals

### Unacceptable Behavior
- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks
- Trolling, insulting comments, or deliberate disruption of technical discussions  
- Publishing private information without explicit permission
- Any conduct that would be considered inappropriate in a professional software development environment

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:
- All project repositories and issues
- Pull request discussions and code reviews
- Community discussions about In-Memoria's architecture, features, or AI development practices
- Public representation of the project at conferences or online forums
- Private correspondence when representing the project

## AI and Technology Ethics

Given In-Memoria's role in AI-assisted development, we encourage:
- **Responsible AI development** practices in contributions
- **Transparency** about algorithmic decisions and pattern learning approaches
- **Privacy-first design** principles (following our local-only data philosophy)
- **Open discussion** of potential biases in pattern detection or code analysis

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainer at the email address listed in package.json. All reports will be reviewed and addressed promptly and confidentially.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject:
- Comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that don't align with this Code of Conduct
