# Security Policy

## Our Security Commitment

In-Memoria is committed to maintaining the security and privacy of developers using our AI-assisted development infrastructure. Given our role in analyzing codebases and providing intelligence to AI assistants, we take security seriously.

## Supported Versions

Security updates are provided for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.4.x   | ✅ Yes             |
| 0.3.x   | ⚠️ Security fixes only |
| < 0.3   | ❌ No              |

## Security Principles

### Local-First Security
- **All data stays local** - no code or intelligence data is transmitted to external servers
- **No telemetry** - In-Memoria doesn't collect usage data or send analytics
- **Optional cloud features** - Vector embeddings (OpenAI) are opt-in only

### Data Protection
- **Filesystem access** - Only reads files you explicitly analyze
- **Database security** - SQLite database stored locally with no external access
- **Memory safety** - Rust core provides memory-safe code analysis

### AI Integration Security
- **MCP protocol compliance** - Follows MCP security standards for AI tool integration
- **Sandboxed execution** - Analysis runs in isolated processes
- **No code execution** - Only static analysis, never executes analyzed code

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing the maintainer directly. You can find the email address in the `package.json` file under the `author` field.

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

1. **Component affected** (Rust core, TypeScript layer, MCP integration, CLI)
2. **Vulnerability type** (code injection, path traversal, data exposure, etc.)
3. **Steps to reproduce** the security issue
4. **Potential impact** and affected systems
5. **Suggested mitigation** if you have ideas

### Example Security Concerns

Please report issues like:
- **Code injection** through malicious file content
- **Path traversal** vulnerabilities in file analysis
- **Data exposure** of analyzed code to unintended recipients
- **MCP protocol** security bypasses
- **Memory safety** issues in Rust bindings
- **Privilege escalation** in CLI commands
- **Supply chain** vulnerabilities in dependencies

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Safe Usage
- **Review permissions** - Only run In-Memoria on codebases you trust
- **Limit scope** - Use file patterns to exclude sensitive directories
- **Regular updates** - Keep In-Memoria updated to latest secure version
- **Environment isolation** - Consider running in containers for sensitive codebases

### MCP Integration Security
- **Validate MCP clients** - Only connect trusted AI assistants
- **Review tool permissions** - Understand what data MCP tools can access
- **Monitor tool usage** - Be aware of what analysis tools are being called

### Data Handling
- **Backup intelligence** - Intelligence databases are local assets
- **Access control** - Protect `.in-memoria.db` files with appropriate file permissions
- **Clean up** - Remove intelligence data when no longer needed

## Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours of receiving the report
- **Initial assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Status updates**: Weekly until resolved
- **Resolution**: Based on severity (Critical: <72h, High: <2weeks, Medium: <1month)

## Disclosure Policy

- Security vulnerabilities will be disclosed responsibly
- Fixes will be released before public disclosure
- Credit will be given to security researchers (if desired)
- CVE numbers will be requested for significant vulnerabilities

## Security Architecture

### Rust Core Security
- **Memory safety** - No buffer overflows or use-after-free vulnerabilities
- **Input validation** - All file content and user input is validated
- **Error handling** - Proper error propagation prevents crashes
- **Dependency auditing** - Regular security audits of Rust dependencies

### TypeScript Layer Security
- **Input sanitization** - File paths and CLI arguments are sanitized
- **Process isolation** - Child processes run with limited privileges
- **Error boundaries** - Proper error handling prevents information leaks
- **Dependency management** - Regular npm audit and updates
